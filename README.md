# demo_collab

This is a collaborative effort to create a working piece of code which actually collates all your piece of codes merged into the master repository. 

## Success Criteria

A script called our_script.sh which when executed should work as it is expected to.

## Steps

Step 1

 - Please collaborate yourselves in whatsapp/mail etc and decide which module of code you're working on. 

Step 2

- Create you own branch from the master

Step 3

 - Copy that respectively from demo_script.sh and put it in the our_script.sh. ALso you need to create a .txt file in your name in your branch with the same content you're putting in the script our_script.sh. Add/Modify and commit to your local branch

Step 4

 - Push your local branch to the remote

Step 5

 - Create a pull request (PR) to get your code merged to the master by the project coordinator/maintainer

 ``` Happy Coding :-)
